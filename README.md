> **This is not a fork.** The VS Code extension and the four hook scripts were written from scratch, but the architecture and the endpoint knowledge come from the projects above.

Monitor Claude Pro / Max usage limits (5-hour session + 7-day weekly) and orchestrate context handoff when limits are hit.

Two complementary parts:

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **vscode-extension/** | Status bar item in VS Code showing live 5h / 7d / Sonnet usage with countdown to reset. |
| **hooks/** | Claude Code hooks for the CLI: warns at 80%, captures handoff state on `StopFailure(rate_limit)`, restores it on `SessionStart`. |

Works with Claude Pro and Max plans (OAuth auth) — does **not** require an API key.

---

## Why

Anthropic does not yet expose a `ContextThreshold` hook (see [issue #25689](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/25689)) and the official `StopFailure` hook fires for side effects only — it cannot block or auto-resume.

This repo fills the gap with two minimal-footprint components:

1. **Visibility:** see how much of your 5-hour session and weekly quota you've used, in real time, in VS Code's status bar.
2. **Continuity:** when you do hit the wall, your active todos + recently modified files + objective are persisted to `~/.claude/rl-handoff.json`. The next fresh `claude` session in the same project picks them up automatically.

---

## Install — VS Code extension

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DRT-Systems/claude-rl-monitor.git
cd claude-rl-monitor/vscode-extension
npm install -g @vscode/vsce
vsce package --allow-missing-repository
code --install-extension claude-rl-monitor-1.1.0.vsix
```

Reload VS Code window. Status bar (bottom right) shows:

```
✓ 5h:38%  7d:33%  ↺1h30m
```

Color-coded: green <50%, blue ≥50%, yellow ≥80%, red ≥90%.

### Configuration

| Setting | Default | Range |
|---|---|---|
| `claudeRlMonitor.pollIntervalSeconds` | 300 | 120–1800 |
| `claudeRlMonitor.credentialsPath` | `~/.claude/.credentials.json` | absolute path |

The extension polls `https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` (an undocumented endpoint discovered by the community) using the OAuth token from `~/.claude/.credentials.json`. On HTTP 429 it backs off (honoring `Retry-After`) and shows cached data so the bar does not flap.

---

## Install — Claude Code hooks (CLI)

Copy the four hook scripts:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/hooks
cp hooks/*.js ~/.claude/hooks/
```

Then merge the snippet from [`docs/settings-example.json`](docs/settings-example.json) into `~/.claude/settings.json`. The `statusLine` entry replaces any previous one — the script inlines support for the [caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman) plugin's mode indicator so you do not lose it.

### What each hook does

| Hook | Event | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `rl-statusline.js` | `statusLine` | Reads `rate_limits.*.used_percentage` from the JSON Claude Code feeds the statusline; renders `[CAVEMAN] │ 5h:38% 7d:33% ↺1h30m`; writes `~/.claude/.rl_warn` flag at ≥80%. |
| `rl-warn.js` | `UserPromptSubmit` | When flag exists, injects an `additionalContext` warning into the next message. Auto-snoozes 10 min between warnings. |
| `rl-stop-failure.js` | `StopFailure(rate_limit)` | Parses the current session JSONL → extracts active todos + last 10 modified files + first user message; writes `~/.claude/rl-handoff.json`; sends a Windows balloon notification. |
| `rl-session-start.js` | `SessionStart` (startup only) | If a handoff file <8h old exists for the same project, injects it as `additionalContext` then deletes it (one-shot). |

### Caveat — Claude Pro auth and the statusLine hook

The `statusLine` hook receives `rate_limits` data only when Claude Code emits it. With Claude Pro / Max OAuth auth, this is reliable on Claude Code v2.1.80+. If you authenticate with an API key, token counts are exposed differently and the hook still works. If neither exposes the data, the bar stays empty but does not error.

## Compatibility

- **Claude Code:** v2.1.80+ (for the `rate_limits` field in statusLine input)
- **Node.js:** v18+ (uses `node:https`, no external deps)
- **VS Code:** v1.80+
- **OS:** Windows (PowerShell toast in StopFailure hook), macOS / Linux untested but the statusLine + warn + session-start hooks are pure Node.js and should work; the StopFailure hook's notification path is Windows-specific and can be swapped for `osascript` / `notify-send`.

## Credits and prior art

This project is a **synthesis of three community projects**. Nothing here is novel architecture — the value is combining them into a single working setup for VS Code + Claude Code on Windows with Claude Pro auth.

### 1. [`ohugonnot/claude-code-statusline`](https://github.com/ohugonnot/claude-code-statusline) (MIT)
**Used for:** the OAuth usage endpoint discovery (`https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`), the OAuth token location (`~/.claude/.credentials.json` → `claudeAiOauth.accessToken`), the percentage-bar rendering pattern, and the cache + atomic-write approach.

The VS Code extension (`vscode-extension/extension.js`) is a JavaScript/TypeScript reimplementation of the polling logic from ohugonnot's bash `statusline.sh`. Without their endpoint discovery, this whole project would not work for Pro auth.

### 2. [`elb-pr/claudikins-automatic-context-manager`](https://github.com/elb-pr/claudikins-automatic-context-manager) (MIT)
**Used for:** the flag-file bridge (`~/.claude/.rl_warn`) between the `statusLine` hook (which sees percentages but cannot inject prompts) and the `UserPromptSubmit` hook (which can inject but does not see token data), the handoff-state JSON format, and the snooze/dismiss state pattern.

The hooks `rl-statusline.js`, `rl-warn.js`, and `rl-stop-failure.js` follow claudikins' two-phase pattern: statusline writes flag, hook reads flag and injects context.

### 3. [DEV.to article by karthiknitt — "Shell Wrapper That Makes Claude Code Auto-Resume After Rate Limits"](https://dev.to/karthikeyan_natarajan_1cb/i-built-a-shell-wrapper-that-makes-claude-code-auto-resume-after-rate-limits-2lje) ([source](https://github.com/karthiknitt/smart_resume))
**Used for:** the `rate_limits.{five_hour,seven_day}.{used_percentage,resets_at}` JSON shape from the `statusLine` hook input (which Claude Code v2.1.80+ now emits natively — this article documented it), reset-epoch parsing, and the `Retry-After` backoff approach on HTTP 429.

The auto-resume wrapper from this article (`claude-smart-resume.sh`) is **not** included here because it requires a wrapped CLI binary, which does not work with the VS Code extension. We use the `StopFailure(rate_limit)` hook + Windows toast + `SessionStart` handoff replay instead.
